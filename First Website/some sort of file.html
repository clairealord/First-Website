<h1>Claire Lord</h1>

<p>Hi! I'm Claire and I was born December 20th, 2005 here in Vancouver. I have a brother and a pet horse. And no I am not joking. I consider myself a bit of a conousour of 70s and 80s pop culture. My favourite artist is Queen and I love watching Monty Python shows. Especially Flying Circus.</p>

<p> I have a pet horse named Tia, and I ride her twice a week. But she only cooperates if I give her treats. I love playing video games and my favourite game is Overwatch. I play as D.Va and Widowmaker. I also like playing Rainbow 6: Seige.</p>
